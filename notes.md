You will continue to be billed for supply in cents per kWh, just as you were on your prior rate. But you will be charged a higher price during peak hours and a lower price during off-peak hours.

Under the Select Pricing Plan, youâ€™ll be billed for delivery in dollars per kilowatt (kW) rather than in cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).
